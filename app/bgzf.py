"""BGZF (Blocked GNU Zip Format) validation and index auditing.

A BGZF archive is a concatenation of gzip members.  Every member is a
complete gzip block carrying one ``BC`` extra subfield that declares the
total member size minus one (``BSIZE``).  Deflate data lives in its own
zlib "raw" stream per member, which makes every block independently
seekable.  A valid archive ends with exactly one canonical 28-byte empty
member (the BGZF EOF sentinel) and has no trailing bytes.

The companion index is a little-endian unsigned 64-bit structure::

    uint64 count
    (uint64 compressed_start, uint64 uncompressed_start) * count

with one entry for every data block except the first, recording the
block's compressed-file offset and the cumulative decompressed offset at
which its payload begins.
